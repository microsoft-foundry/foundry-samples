**IMPORTANT!** All samples and other resources made available in this GitHub repository ("samples") are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents, solutions, and agent workflows for various scenarios. Review all provided resources and carefully test output behavior in the context of your use case. AI responses may be inaccurate and AI actions should be monitored with human oversight.

# Background Agent — Responses Protocol (Long-Running)

This sample demonstrates a long-running agent built with [azure-ai-agentserver-responses](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-responses/) that uses the background execution mode for asynchronous processing. It calls Azure OpenAI to generate a multi-section research analysis, streaming LLM tokens as they arrive via the Responses API event lifecycle.

## How It Works

The agent receives a request via `POST /responses` with `"background": true`. The server returns immediately while the handler calls Azure OpenAI in the background, streaming response tokens as `text.delta` events. The caller polls `GET /responses/{id}` until the response reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `incomplete`). In-flight requests can be cancelled via `POST /responses/{id}/cancel`.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Foundry project with a deployed model

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent starts on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Invoke the local agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"
```

Or test background and synchronous modes directly with curl:

```bash
# Background mode — submit a research analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "research", "input": "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare", "background": true, "store": true}'

# Poll for result (use the id from the response)
curl http://localhost:8088/responses/<response_id>

# Cancel an in-flight request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses/<response_id>/cancel

# Default (synchronous) mode
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "research", "input": "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"}'
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd provision
azd deploy
```

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"
```

To stream logs from the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Azure AI Foundry hosted agents](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs).

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. For debugging Python in VS Code, install the **[Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)** extension pack.

### Set up the Python virtual environment

- With Python 3.12 or later and [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/), install uv outside the project environment, then let uv create and synchronize the locked environment:

  ```bash
  cd src/background-agent-responses

  pipx install uv==0.11.7
  uv sync --frozen --python 3.12
  ```
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), run **Python: Select Interpreter**, and select `src/background-agent-responses/.venv`.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Chat with the agent in the Inspector.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Set the required environment variables and sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI (`az login`).
2. From `src/background-agent-responses`, start the agent: `uv run --no-sync python main.py` (listens on `http://localhost:8088`).
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

**Deploy with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
