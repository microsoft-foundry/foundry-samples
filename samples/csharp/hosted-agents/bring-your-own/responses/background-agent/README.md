**IMPORTANT!** All samples and other resources made available in this GitHub repository ("samples") are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents, solutions, and agent workflows for various scenarios. Review all provided resources and carefully test output behavior in the context of your use case. AI responses may be inaccurate and AI actions should be monitored with human oversight.

# Background Agent (Responses Protocol) — .NET

This sample demonstrates a long-running agent built with [Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses) that uses the background execution mode for asynchronous processing. It calls Azure OpenAI to generate a multi-section research analysis, streaming LLM tokens as they arrive via the Responses API event lifecycle.

## How It Works

The agent receives a request via `POST /responses` with `"background": true`. The server returns immediately while the handler calls Azure OpenAI in the background, streaming response tokens as `text.delta` events. The caller polls `GET /responses/{id}` until the response reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `incomplete`). In-flight requests can be cancelled via `POST /responses/{id}/cancel`.

The handler itself stays simple — background mode, polling, and cancellation are all managed by the SDK automatically.

## Prerequisites

1. An existing Foundry project with an Azure OpenAI model deployment (or create them during setup in Option 1).
2. **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** or later.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Azure AI Foundry project endpoint (auto-injected when deployed) |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Azure OpenAI model deployment name (e.g., `gpt-5.4-mini`) |

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir background-agent && cd background-agent
azd ai agent init -t https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/responses/background-agent/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, invoke the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"
```

**Background mode** — submit asynchronously, then poll for the result:

```bash
# Submit a background research analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "research", "input": "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare", "background": true, "store": true}'

# Poll for result (use the id from the response)
curl http://localhost:8088/responses/<response_id>

# Cancel an in-flight request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses/<response_id>/cancel
```

**Default (synchronous) mode:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "research", "input": "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"}'
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"
```

Stream logs from the running agent with `azd ai agent monitor`.

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **C#: Check Workspace Requirements** to confirm the toolchain is ready.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Chat with the agent in the Inspector.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. Configure the agent: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. The agent loads `.env` automatically on startup.

3. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

4. Start the agent (listens on `http://localhost:8088`):

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

**Deploy with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
