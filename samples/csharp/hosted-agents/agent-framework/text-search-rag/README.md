# What this sample demonstrates

A support specialist agent with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) — the **Text Search RAG Agent (Responses Protocol)** sample demonstrates how to ground agent answers in external knowledge using `TextSearchProvider` via [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework).

## How It Works

The agent uses a `TextSearchProvider` to search through a knowledge base of support documents. When a user asks a question, the framework retrieves relevant text passages, injects them as context for the LLM, and the model composes an answer grounded in the retrieved information — reducing hallucination and ensuring responses reflect the actual support documentation.

See [Program.cs](src/text-search-rag/Program.cs) for the full implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. An existing Foundry project with a deployed model (or create them during setup in Option 1 — `azd provision` can create them for you).
2. **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** or later.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Foundry project endpoint. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set automatically by `azd ai agent run` locally. |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Yes | Model deployment name — must match your Foundry project deployment. Declared in `azure.yaml`. |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Recommended | Enables telemetry. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set manually for local dev. |

When using `azd ai agent run`, these are handled automatically. For manual runs, set them in your shell — .NET does not read `.env` files natively.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir text-search-rag-agent && cd text-search-rag-agent
azd ai agent init --deploy-mode container -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/agent-framework/text-search-rag/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

> If you already have a Foundry project and model deployment, add `-p <project-id> -d <deployment-name>` to `azd ai agent init` to target existing resources.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, invoke the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is your return policy?"
```

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "How long does shipping take?"
azd ai agent invoke --local "How do I clean my tent?"
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "What is your return policy?"
```

Stream logs from the running agent with `azd ai agent monitor`.

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **C#: Check Workspace Requirements** to confirm the toolchain is ready.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Chat with the agent in the Inspector.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. Configure the agent: create a `.env` file with the [required variables](#environment-variables). The sample loads `.env` automatically on startup.

3. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI so `DefaultAzureCredential` can authenticate the terminal process (the **F5** path reuses the Azure sign-in from the Foundry Toolkit, so it doesn't need a separate `az login`):

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

4. Start the agent (listens on `http://localhost:8088`):

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

**Deploy with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
